# Cosmic Transistor
This script is to collect data from a test setup to test the failure rate of certain MOSFETs when under attack by cosmic rays. The setup has MOSFETs connected to a power supply ranging up to 1200V and a neutron beam is shot on them to accelerate the effect of cosmic rays. 

This script runs on a Raspberry Pi to record the data of the failures that happen at every voltage step. 

Additionally, the script also records the test voltages used for a particular measurement by using an ADC with the Raspberry Pi.
